<analysis>
The AI engineer successfully bootstrapped the Aman cybersecurity platform from scratch, establishing a full-stack architecture comprising a FastAPI backend, React frontend, and MongoDB. The project advanced through well-defined phases: Foundation & Infrastructure (Phase 1), Landing Page Development (Phase 2), and Dashboard Core Layout (Phase 3), the latter being proactively enhanced with features from later phases. A critical frontend display issue was resolved. Subsequently, the user prioritized browser extension development (Phase 6A), which was fully implemented. A significant interruption involved resolving persistent  and  conflicts. Following this, Phase 6 (Secure Backend API Development) was completed, involving a substantial rewrite of backend modules for authentication and database integration. This was immediately followed by Phase 6B (Frontend Authentication Integration), which successfully connected the frontend to the secure backend, replacing mock data with real data. The current work halted at the beginning of Phase 7 (Email Scanning Core Logic) as per the user's latest instruction.

<product_requirements>
The Aman cybersecurity platform aims to provide real-time phishing detection and protection for Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs) in regulated sectors. The core problem it solves is the vulnerability of businesses to sophisticated phishing attacks through email. The application is envisioned with several key components: a browser extension (for Gmail/Outlook), a scalable AI model for detection, a secure backend, user/admin dashboards, and a federated learning framework for ML.

So far, the product has implemented:
-   **Landing Page**: A public-facing site showcasing the mission, services, team, and demo request functionality, built to be responsive with a green, white, and black color scheme.
-   **Dashboard (User/Org Interface)**: Features secure login (now fully implemented with JWT), a sidebar for navigation, circular statistics (Phishing Emails Caught, Safe Emails, Potential Phishing), a Recent Email Scans box with color-coded entries, and functional User Profile and Settings pages. It now displays real data from the database.
-   **Browser Extension**: Initial scaffolding for a Chrome extension (Manifest v3) with placeholder files for background services, content scripts, and popup UI.

<current_work>
The project has successfully completed several major phases, culminating in a robust, authenticated full-stack application.

**Phase 1 (Foundation & Infrastructure Setup)**, **Phase 2 (Landing Page Development)**, and **Phase 3 (Dashboard Core Layout)** are fully complete, providing a responsive React frontend and a FastAPI backend connected to MongoDB. The frontend displays mock data for statistics and emails in Dashboard.

**Phase 6A (Browser Extension Preparation)** involved setting up the basic directory structure and essential files (, , , , etc.) for a Chrome extension (Manifest v3). This phase is structurally complete, awaiting integration with the backend APIs.

**Phase 6 (Secure Backend API Development)** significantly enhanced the backend.  was updated with security packages. New modules , , and  were created to handle robust JWT-based authentication, password hashing, and data modeling.  was completely rewritten to integrate these security features and utilize  for real MongoDB interactions, providing authenticated endpoints for dashboard data (statistics, recent emails, user profile).

**Phase 6B (Frontend Authentication Integration)** addressed the critical gap of connecting the frontend to the secure backend. New React components were developed:  for global authentication state, , , and  for user interaction, and  to guard authenticated routes.  was updated to incorporate the authentication context and routing, while , , , and  were modified to use the authentication context and fetch real data from the backend. This successfully eliminated 403 Forbidden errors and replaced mock data with live database metrics.

Immediately before this summary, the AI engineer was instructed to proceed with **Phase 7: Email Scanning Core Logic**. The initial steps for Phase 7 involved creating new backend files:  for core scanning logic,  for feedback mechanisms, and  for enhanced link checking. The next step is to integrate these into .
