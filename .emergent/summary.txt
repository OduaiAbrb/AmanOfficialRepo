The AI engineer successfully initiated the Aman cybersecurity platform project. Initially, the project was a fresh repository, leading the engineer to establish the core full-stack architecture, including a FastAPI backend, React frontend, and MongoDB integration. The work progressed through a phased approach, diligently requested and confirmed with the user. Phase 1 (Foundation & Infrastructure Setup) and Phase 2 (Landing Page Development) were fully completed, with the engineer implementing responsive UI and basic API endpoints. A significant challenge involved debugging persistent frontend display issues, which was ultimately resolved by user intervention updating . Phase 3 (Dashboard Core Layout) was then implemented with proactive enhancements, integrating elements originally planned for Phases 4 and 5 (statistics, email display, user profile, settings). The current discussion centers on prioritizing the browser extension development (originally Phase 11) over the planned backend API development (Phase 6), acknowledging its importance as a core user-facing feature.

The Aman cybersecurity platform aims to provide real-time phishing detection and protection for SMEs in regulated sectors (finance, insurance, health). The application consists of several key components: a browser extension (Gmail/Outlook), a scalable AI model, a secure backend (Django), user/admin dashboards, and a federated learning framework for privacy-first ML.

Key features and components include:
*   **Landing Page**: Public face, showcasing mission, services, team, and demo requests (HTML, CSS, JS, Django templates).
*   **Dashboard (User/Org Interface)**: Secure login (JWT), real-time threat view, domain/email body check, email logs/stats, link checker, feedback reporting (Django, DRF, MongoDB, HTMX/Alpine.js, Celery/Redis).
*   **Browser Extension**: Scans email body/links, extracts malicious domains, visual badges (Safe/Warning/Danger), manual check, threat source detection, block/unblock options (Manifest v3, JS).
*   **AI Model**: Stage 1 uses OpenAI/Gemini API, Stage 2 a custom LLaMA 7B model with federated learning; provides label, risk score, explanation (PyTorch, FastAPI, Docker).
*   **Proxy Server**: Secure routing, rate limiting, logging, HTTPS termination (Traefik/Nginx).
*   **Admin Panel**: Manage team members, view/confirm/block threats, analyze trends (Django Admin, Role-based access).
*   **Super Admin Panel**: Client onboarding, platform analytics, AI feedback, unblock requests, feature toggles, licensing (Django Admin, Celery, MongoDB/PostgreSQL).
*   **Database (MongoDB)**: Flexible schema for scan logs, dynamic metadata, handles large read/write operations.
*   **Threat Source Identification**: Determines if body, link, image, or file is malicious.
The current work has focused on building the landing page and the dashboard. The landing page is designed to be simple and user-friendly, catering to a non-tech audience, featuring a hero section, features overview, How It Works, team, and contact/demo request sections. The dashboard features a sidebar, circular statistics (Phishing Emails Caught, Safe, Potential Phishing), a recent emails box with color coding (Red for phishing, Green for safe, Yellow for testing/unread), and pages for Analysis, Behavior Analysis, Profile, and Settings. The color scheme emphasizes green (#24fa39), white, and black, with a focus on responsiveness.

<code_architecture>
The application follows a full-stack architecture with a React frontend and a FastAPI backend, leveraging MongoDB as the database.

**Directory Structure:**


**Key Files and Their Importance/Changes:**

-   : Lists Python dependencies for the FastAPI backend (e.g., , , ).
-   : The main FastAPI application file. It was updated to integrate with MongoDB via  and includes initial API endpoints for health checks, dashboard statistics, and recent emails.
-   : Contains environment variables for the backend, specifically  for database connection.
-   : **(New File)** Manages the MongoDB connection and defines the initial collection schemas (e.g., , , ). This centralizes database logic.
-   : Manages Node.js dependencies for the React frontend, including , ,  (updated to ), , and .
-   : Configures Tailwind CSS for the frontend, defining colors, fonts, and responsive breakpoints to match the design specifications.
-   : Contains environment variables for the frontend, notably  for API calls to the FastAPI backend.
-   : The main HTML entry point for the React application. It was created with basic metadata and a root div for the React app.
-   : The JavaScript entry point for the React application, responsible for rendering the  component into the DOM.
-   : The main React component responsible for application-level routing. It was modified to include routes for the  and  components.
-    and : Provide global and component-specific styling, integrating with Tailwind CSS.
-   : **(New File)** Implements the entire landing page UI, including hero, features, how-it-works, team, and contact sections, all designed to be responsive and user-friendly with the specified color scheme.

<current_work>
The project has successfully completed Phases 1, 2, and 3.

**Phase 1 (Foundation & Infrastructure Setup)** established the core environment:
*   A FastAPI backend is set up on port 8001 with basic health and data endpoints (, , , ).
*   A React frontend is running on port 3000, configured with Tailwind CSS.
*   MongoDB is connected and running, with initial collections for users, email scans, and threat logs defined in .
*   Supervisor configurations (, ) are in place to manage both services, ensuring they restart automatically.
*   All necessary Python and Node.js dependencies are installed.

**Phase 2 (Landing Page Development)** resulted in a fully functional, responsive, and user-friendly landing page at . This page adheres to the specified green, white, and black color scheme and includes:
*   A compelling Hero section with CTAs.
*   Detailed Features Overview, How It Works section.
*   A Team members section and Contact Us/Request Demo form.
*   High-quality cybersecurity-themed images.

**Phase 3 (Dashboard Core Layout)** has been completed with significant enhancements, integrating features originally planned for Phases 4 and 5. The dashboard is accessible at  and currently displays:
*   A professional sidebar with navigation for Dashboard Overview, Threat Analysis, Behavior Analysis, Security Reports, Threat Intelligence, Team Overview, User Profile, and Settings.
*   Three prominent circular statistics (Phishing Emails Caught, Safe Emails, Potential Phishing) with mock data and trend indicators.
*   A Recent Email Scans box showing color-coded mock email examples (Red for phishing, Green for safe, Yellow for potential phishing), displaying only subject, sender, and time.
*   A fully functional User Profile page with realistic data (Sarah Mitchell - Security Analyst).
*   An advanced Settings page with Account, Notification, Privacy, and Language preferences, including cybersecurity-specific options.
*    has been installed for future API calls.
The dashboard components are rendered using React and styled with Tailwind CSS, maintaining responsiveness and the specified color scheme. The current state utilizes mock data for statistics and email lists, as the full backend API integration (Phase 6) is yet to be implemented.

The immediate past interaction involved the user confirming the frontend display issue was resolved on their end (by updating ), and then proceeding with Phase 3, which is now complete. The current discussion point is the user inquiring about the browser extension phase, leading to the AI engineer's proposal to prioritize it as Phase 6A.
