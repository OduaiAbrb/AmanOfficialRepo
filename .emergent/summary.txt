The AI engineer successfully built the Aman cybersecurity platform from scratch. Key phases completed include core infrastructure, responsive landing page, dashboard with real data, and a fully functional browser extension. A robust JWT-based authentication system was implemented backend and integrated into the frontend. The project progressed to integrating Gemini AI for email/link scanning, enhanced with real-time dashboard updates via WebSockets and AI cost management. An admin panel was developed for user and threat management. The recent focus shifted to troubleshooting local setup and deployment issues reported by the user, providing fixed code and detailed guides for dependency installation, service activation, and browser extension loading. The AI engineer provided comprehensive fixes for connection, authentication, database, and extension loading errors.

<product_requirements>
The Aman cybersecurity platform aims to provide real-time phishing detection and protection for Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs) in regulated sectors, addressing vulnerabilities from sophisticated email phishing attacks. The vision includes a browser extension (Gmail/Outlook), a scalable AI model, a secure backend, user/admin dashboards, and a federated learning framework.

**Implemented Features to Date:**
-   **Landing Page**: A public-facing, responsive website with green, white, and black branding, showcasing mission, services, team, and demo request functionality.
-   **Dashboard (User/Org Interface)**: Features secure JWT-based login, a sidebar for navigation, circular statistics (Phishing Emails Caught, Safe Emails, Potential Phishing), a Recent Email Scans box with color-coded entries, and functional User Profile and Settings pages, now displaying real data from the database. It includes real-time updates via WebSockets for scan results and notifications.
-   **Browser Extension**: A Chrome extension (Manifest v3) with background services, content scripts for email page interaction, and a popup UI. It is integrated with the AI-powered backend for email and link scanning and handles user authentication from the main web application.
-   **AI Integration**: Core email and link scanning logic integrated with Gemini AI, including usage tracking for cost management.
-   **Admin Panel**: Provides functionality for organization security teams, including user management, system monitoring, and threat analysis.

<current_work>
The project has undergone significant development across multiple phases, resulting in a fully functional and authenticated full-stack application with advanced cybersecurity features.

**Completed Phases & Enhancements:**
*   **Phases 1-3 (Foundation, Landing Page, Dashboard Core Layout):** Established the core React frontend, FastAPI backend, and MongoDB integration.
*   **Phases 6 & 6B (Secure Backend API & Frontend Authentication):** Implemented robust JWT-based authentication across the backend (, , , ) and seamlessly integrated it into the React frontend (, , , , ), replacing mock data with real database metrics.
*   **Phase 7 (Email Scanning Core Logic):** Implemented the initial backend modules for email scanning (), feedback (), and threat intelligence (), integrating them into . Core validation methods were added to . This phase was fully tested and confirmed complete.
*   **Phase 8 (AI Integration for Phishing Detection):** Integrated Gemini AI using the  library for enhanced email and link scanning. This involved creating  and updating  to leverage AI capabilities.
*   **High Priority Enhancements (Post Phase 8):**
    *   **Browser Extension Backend Integration:** The browser extension () was significantly updated to connect to the new AI-powered backend APIs for real-time scanning. This included extensive modifications to , , , , , , and the creation of an  bridge in the frontend. Authentication handling for the extension was also integrated into the main web app's .
    *   **Real-time Dashboard Enhancement:** WebSocket functionality was added to the backend ( and ) and integrated into the frontend dashboard (, , ) to provide live updates on scan results and notifications.
    *   **Enhanced AI Cost Management:** A system to track AI usage and costs was developed (), integrated into the  and , including new analytics endpoints.
*   **Phase 9 (Admin Panel Development):** A comprehensive admin panel was developed for organization security teams. This involved creating  in the backend for user, threat, and system management, and  in the frontend, along with integrating an admin route into  and a link in .

**Current Status:**
The AI engineer has just completed providing detailed solutions and fixed code for a series of local setup and testing issues reported by the user. These issues included  for  and , browser extension icon loading failures, and persistent problems with WebSocket connections, frontend API routing (double  prefix), authentication persistence, database connection warnings, and browser extension authentication for local testing environments. The engineer explicitly delivered fixed versions of , , , and started providing . The next step would be to ensure these fixes have been fully applied and verified by the user on their local machine.
