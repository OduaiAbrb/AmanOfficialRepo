The previous AI engineer successfully bootstrapped the Aman cybersecurity platform, building a full-stack application using FastAPI, React, and MongoDB. The development progressed through several key phases: foundational setup, landing page, dashboard core, secure backend with JWT authentication, and frontend integration. Crucially, Phase 7 (Email Scanning) and Phase 8 (AI Integration with Gemini) were implemented and tested, adding real-time features and AI cost management. Phase 9 (Admin Panel) was initiated with backend and frontend components. A significant portion of the recent work involved extensive troubleshooting of local development setup, including dependency issues, incorrect URL configurations, browser extension loading errors, and authentication persistence problems, culminating in providing direct code fixes for core files.

<product_requirements>
The Aman cybersecurity platform aims to provide real-time phishing detection and protection for Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs) in regulated sectors. The core problem it solves is businesses' vulnerability to sophisticated phishing attacks via email. The platform is envisioned with a browser extension (for Gmail/Outlook), a scalable AI model, a secure backend, user/admin dashboards, and a federated learning framework for ML.

So far, the product has implemented:
*   **Landing Page**: A responsive, public-facing site showcasing the mission, services, team, and demo request functionality.
*   **Dashboard (User/Org Interface)**: Features secure JWT-authenticated login, sidebar navigation, circular statistics (Phishing Emails Caught, Safe Emails, Potential Phishing), a Recent Email Scans box with color-coded entries, and functional User Profile/Settings pages. It now displays real data from the database and supports real-time updates via WebSockets.
*   **Browser Extension**: Initial scaffolding (Manifest v3) is complete and integrated with the AI-powered backend for real-time scanning and authentication.
*   **AI Integration**: Core email and link scanning logic implemented with Gemini AI.
*   **Admin Panel**: Basic structure and endpoints for managing users and viewing system analytics are in place.

<current_work>
The project is in a highly developed state, with core features including a secure, authenticated full-stack application (FastAPI backend, React frontend, MongoDB), AI-powered email and link scanning (Gemini integration), real-time dashboard updates via WebSockets, and an integrated AI cost management system. The browser extension is also fully integrated with the backend for real-time scanning and authentication.

Most recently, the focus has shifted to ensuring the local development environment is fully functional and addressing various reported issues. The previous AI engineer has:
1.  **Completed Phase 7 (Email Scanning Core Logic)**: Implemented and tested core backend logic for email content analysis, link checking, threat identification, and feedback systems.
2.  **Completed Phase 8 (AI Integration for Phishing Detection)**: Integrated Gemini AI for advanced email and link scanning, and deployed AI cost management.
3.  **Completed High Priority Enhancements**:
    *   **Browser Extension Backend Integration**: Updated the Chrome extension to leverage the AI-powered backend for scanning and integrated authentication with the main web application.
    *   **Real-time Dashboard Enhancement**: Integrated WebSockets into both backend and frontend to provide live updates and notifications on the dashboard.
    *   **Enhanced AI Cost Management**: Implemented a system to track and manage AI usage costs.
4.  **Initiated and Progressed Phase 9 (Admin Panel Development)**: Created backend () and frontend () components, added relevant API endpoints, and integrated routes and navigation links.
5.  **Extensively Troubleshot Local Setup Issues**: Provided comprehensive guides for local system activation and debugging. Specifically addressed:
    *   Missing backend dependencies (, ).
    *   Browser extension loading failures due to missing icons and  configurations.
    *   Persistent connection issues (e.g., WebSocket failures, frontend hitting wrong URLs like ), and authentication problems (token persistence, extension authentication).
    *   Database connectivity warnings.

The work halted while the previous AI engineer was providing direct code fixes for critical files to resolve these persistent local environment issues, specifically having just provided  and , and was in the process of providing . The immediate next step is to deliver the complete fixed  and instruct on further testing.
