# Aman Cybersecurity Platform - Development Progress

## Project Overview
Building a comprehensive cybersecurity platform that provides real-time phishing detection and protection for SMEs in regulated sectors. The platform includes a landing page, dashboard, browser extension capabilities, and AI-powered phishing detection.

## Testing Protocol
- Backend testing first using `deep_testing_backend_v2`
- Frontend testing only after user permission using `auto_frontend_testing_agent`
- Always read and update this file before invoking testing agents
- Never fix issues already resolved by testing agents

## Phase 1: Foundation & Infrastructure Setup ✅ COMPLETED

### Completed Tasks:
1. ✅ Project structure created (backend/, frontend/)
2. ✅ FastAPI backend with health endpoints
3. ✅ React frontend with Tailwind CSS configuration
4. ✅ Environment files configured (.env)
5. ✅ Dependencies installed (Python + Node.js)
6. ✅ MongoDB connection and database setup
7. ✅ Database collections initialized
8. ✅ Supervisor configuration for service management
9. ✅ All services running and tested

### Technical Implementation:
- **Backend**: FastAPI with Motor (async MongoDB driver)
