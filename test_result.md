# Aman Cybersecurity Platform - Development Progress

## Project Overview
Building a comprehensive cybersecurity platform that provides real-time phishing detection and protection for SMEs in regulated sectors. The platform includes a landing page, dashboard, browser extension capabilities, and AI-powered phishing detection.

## Testing Protocol
- Backend testing first using `deep_testing_backend_v2`
- Frontend testing only after user permission using `auto_frontend_testing_agent`
- Always read and update this file before invoking testing agents
- Never fix issues already resolved by testing agents
