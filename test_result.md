# Aman Cybersecurity Platform - Development Progress

## Project Overview
Building a comprehensive cybersecurity platform that provides real-time phishing detection and protection for SMEs in regulated sectors. The platform includes a landing page, dashboard, browser extension capabilities, and AI-powered phishing detection.

## Testing Protocol
- Backend testing first using `deep_testing_backend_v2`
- Frontend testing only after user permission using `auto_frontend_testing_agent`
- Always read and update this file before invoking testing agents
- Never fix issues already resolved by testing agents

## Phase 1: Foundation & Infrastructure Setup ✅ COMPLETED

### Completed Tasks:
1. ✅ Project structure created (backend/, frontend/)
2. ✅ FastAPI backend with health endpoints
3. ✅ React frontend with Tailwind CSS configuration
4. ✅ Environment files configured (.env)
5. ✅ Dependencies installed (Python + Node.js)
6. ✅ MongoDB connection and database setup
7. ✅ Database collections initialized
8. ✅ Supervisor configuration for service management
9. ✅ All services running and tested

### Technical Implementation:
- **Backend**: FastAPI with Motor (async MongoDB driver)
- **Frontend**: React 18 with Tailwind CSS
- **Database**: MongoDB with proper indexing
- **Services**: Running via supervisor (backend:

## CRITICAL REACT RENDERING ERROR FIXED ✅ RESOLVED (2025-01-27 16:51:00)

### Issue Identified and Fixed:
❌ **Original Problem**: "Objects are not valid as a React child (found: object with keys {type, loc, msg, input, url})"
✅ **Root Cause Found**: FastAPI validation error objects being rendered directly in JSX instead of extracting error message strings
✅ **Solution Implemented**: 
1. Added custom FastAPI exception handlers for RequestValidationError and ValidationError
2. Fixed error handling in AuthContext.js to handle validation error objects/arrays/strings
3. Fixed error rendering in LoginForm.js and RegisterForm.js with type checking
4. Fixed error rendering in Dashboard.js components with type safety

### Backend Fixes Applied:
✅ **FastAPI Validation Error Handler**: Added custom exception handlers to convert Pydantic validation errors to user-friendly string messages
✅ **Dashboard API Fixed**: Corrected method name from `get_dashboard_stats` to `get_user_stats` and fixed field mapping
✅ **AI Integration Fixed**: Resolved dict attribute access issues (scan_result.id → scan_result.get("_id"))
✅ **Recent Emails API Fixed**: Corrected method name and fixed dict field access for database results

### Frontend Fixes Applied:
